UNIVERSITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (UMS) deals with the maintenance of university, college,
faculty, student information within the university. UMS has a relational database, which is used
to store the college, faculty, student, courses and information of a college.
Starting from registration of a new student in the college, it maintains all the details regarding
the attendance and marks of the students. The project deals with retrieval of information through
an intranet based campus wide portal. It collects related information from all the departments
of an organization and maintains files, which are used to generate reports in various forms to
measure individual and overall performance of the students.</h4>

the university including blackboard from anywhere using the Internet. This project report will
provide a detailed account of the functionalities of the user interface which is taken as a
reference to manage a university. Each subsection of this phase report will feature the important
functionalities of the database design.
Development process of the system starts with System analysis. System analysis involves creating
a formal model of the problem to be solved by understanding requirements.
